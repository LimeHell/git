Bones getting stiff
Purple hands, in a lovely trance
Purple hands
Match the luminescent light
Your grips wrapped around them
Just a bit too tight

Bones getting stiff
Purple hands, in a lovely trance
Purple hands
Match the luminescent light
Your grips wrapped around them
Just a bit too tight

A cool guy, musical scenery
And there's a jar of melting marshmallows
The Edison bulb, leaves me wondering
Crumbs of light stain my eyes

They leave me hypnotized
They leave me hypnotized

Bones getting stiff
Purple hands, in a lovely trance
Purple hands
Match the luminescent light
Your grips wrapped around them
Just a bit too tight

Bones getting stiff
Purple hands, in a lovely trance
Purple hands
Match the luminescent light
Your grips wrapped around them
Just a bit too tight

A quiet room
With the smell of fresh lavender
Soft sounds they cease to exist
And so do we
Soft sounds repress the sound of my running
I'm humming

It goes ladadadada
Ice upon my skin
Silence lingering
Ice upon my skin
Silence lingering

Peppermint on my teeth
My jaw sticks and stutters because of it
My soul reeks and it lingers
As frost spreads to the end of my fingers
And his

I think we might be going numb
I feel static at the end of my thumbs
I think we stare at the TV too long
But I rather be stuck than to get up and run

Bones getting stiff
Purple hands, in a lovely trance
Purple hands
Match the luminescent light
Your grips wrapped around them
Just a bit too tight

Bones getting stiff
Purple hands, in a lovely trance
Purple hands
Match the luminescent light
Your grips wrapped around them
Just a bit too tight
