Bones getting stiff
Purple hands, in a lovely trance
Purple hands
Match the luminescent light
Your grips wrapped around them
Just a bit too tight

Bones getting stiff
Purple hands, in a lovely trance
Purple hands
Match the luminescent light
Your grips wrapped around them
Just a bit too tight

A cool guy, musical scenery
And there's a jar of melting marshmallows
The Edison bulb, leaves me wondering
Crumbs of light stain my eyes

They leave me hypnotized
They leave me hypnotized

Bones getting stiff
Purple hands, in a lovely trance
Purple hands
Match the luminescent light
Your grips wrapped around them
Just a bit too tight

Bones getting stiff
Purple hands, in a lovely trance
Purple hands
Match the luminescent light
Your grips wrapped around them
Just a bit too tight

A quiet room
With the smell of fresh lavender
Soft sounds they cease to exist
And so do we
Soft sounds repress the sound of my running
I'm humming
